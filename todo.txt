TODO:
- Merge the shitty eventhandler branch
- Make the clock intro respect the minsec flag
- Create an event handler class which will create groups of Animations and send them to the compositor when certain events happen
- Allow animations to finish when certain events happen using a callback mechanism (and have most of them inherit from this)
    - Related: allow the clock to finish rolling digits before the outro plays
- Add a swipe-like transition to have in the background of messages and stuff
- Fix the pixel format whatever shit so the difference blend mode works properly
- Add a count for missed pings that only stops composition when it reaches a threshold instead of doing it immediately
- Fix the clock timezone
- Accept args to the compositor for the type of device
